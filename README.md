# Esri Open Layers Client Example

This example shows how you can bring in OGC Standards coming from an ArcGIS Server into an Open Layers Client.

Also, since Esri Rest Specification is now OPEN, it's possible to bring in MapServices and Cached maps into the Open Layers Client.

## Open Layers Version
This example uses OpenLayers 2.12

## Getting OpenLayers

OpenLayers lives at http://www.openlayers.org/.  Find details on downloading stable releases or the development version the [development site](http://trac.osgeo.org/openlayers/wiki/HowToDownload).

## Other Information
To get the WFS-T to work, you will need a proxy running on a server.  
My example uses a Java Proxy, which will be included within this repository.
